3. Get some fake MATIC from a facuet. In order to deploy your contract to the Polygon blockchain, your wallet address needs to have some MATIC to make the transaction. Because we're on the Mumbai Testnet, we'll use fake MATIC which you can get from [a faucet like this one](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
